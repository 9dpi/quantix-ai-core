My implementation plan for the Live MVP: Selection: I recommend EUR/USD as they have the most stable real-time data for this test. Continuous Tracking: I will deploy a dedicated script to monitor the price 24/7. It will automatically flag the signal as 'Profit' or 'Loss' the moment your SL/TP levels are hit. Marketing Support: I will provide a simple dashboard view that you can easily screen-record for your TikTok/Instagram reels to show the win-rate transparency. I'm starting the setup for this single-pair live monitor now. Let me know if you agree with EUR/USD or prefer another specific pair to start!" OFFICIAL WRITTEN COMMITMENT: $1,000 LIVE MVP PHASE (EUR/USD) 1. SCOPE OF DELIVERABLES (What you get for $1,000): A Dedicated EUR/USD Signal Engine: High-probability signals based on my proven AI logic, specifically tuned for Forex. Mandatory Signal Content: Each signal will display: Entry Price, Stop-Loss (SL), Take-Profit (TP), Risk-to-Reward ratio, and AI Confidence Score (%). Real-time Automation: Automated delivery of signals directly to your mobile phone/WhatsApp to ensure you can trade immediately. Live Performance Tracker: A private dashboard to record every signal’s result (Profit or Loss) automatically once the trade expires. 2. VERIFICATION & PROOF: TradingView Sync: I will synchronize the data so you can verify every signal’s accuracy against live TradingView charts. Test Account Friendly: The signals are designed for you to test with test money/demo accounts first to prove the win rate before going live.
